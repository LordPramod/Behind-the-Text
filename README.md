# AI Startup Landing Page

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was recently updated to use pnpm, next.js 15, tailwind v4 and motion (new name for framer-motion) along with code quality improvements and refactoring

The **AI Startup Landing Page** project is designed to **elevate** my front-end development skills by crafting a visually striking landing page for a SaaS application using Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, TailwindCSS v4, and Motion (Framer-Motion). This initiative not only aims to refine my expertise in these technologies but also to master Framer Motion, enabling the creation of smooth, professional animations that enhance the user experience and add vibrancy to the landing page.
